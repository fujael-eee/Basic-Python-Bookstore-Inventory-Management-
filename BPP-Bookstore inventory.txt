Project Name: Bookstore Inventory Management.

Solution: In this project , we follow some steps-

Step-1: In the code there should be imported the os for file detection and deletion.

Step-2: There should be two classes. First one is about identifying the particular single book 
        and other one should be about the inventory where the collection of books will be managed by the user. 

Step-3: In the book class there should be included three attributes like title, author and price using __init__ method
        and __str__ method will make it easy to display details of the books.

Step-4. Inventory class will manage a list of books and files to save in the inventory file. 

Step-5: Add_book , View_book , Update_book , Delete_book methods are added in the inventory class to 
        add, display, update books details using it's index and delete a book from the list by it's index.

Step-6: Save_inventory , Load_inventory  will write and read all books in a text file respectively if it exists .
        We will define these things using def keyword and add necessary read/write/append etc modes as required.

Step-7: File handling is done using os.path.exists to check whether it exists or not.

Step-8: Menu is created using a while loop to display a menu for choosing add, view, update, delete and save exit options.
